The folder contains a bunch of scripts used to test the Jaspersoft Studio plugin installation.
The only script that should be launched as main entry point is the testSupportedVersions.sh.
If needed similar scripts should be created.
The remaining scripts in the current folder usually rely on some existing variables.
